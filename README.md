# More-sy
## A not so fun, calcualtor

## Basic Details
### Team Name : Ashwin P Shine's Team
- Team Lead : [Ashwin P Shine] - [ASIET]

### Project Description
It is a simple calculator, which uses morse code as input  (in alphebetical order).

### Problem
Morse code is going `pooff` from this world.Some old veterns still uses it , sometimes challenging people using keyboards on par of pure speed and accuracy. This highly ld , but revolutionary tech needs more recognition.

### Solution

What fun way, to learn something if not without some mathematics. The innovative solution is for you to type the numbers to compute in alphabetics and that too , in morse code. You either learn to send `I love you` to your GF (Assume) in it, propbably making our national security guys gonna follow you OR you just gonna rage quit. Either way, you will learn a thing or two (cause I did!!!).

#Tehnical Details.
